## General Information
- This is a portifolio project that concludes the JavaScript Syntax molule of the Codecademy Full Stack Engeneering path.
- Its main function is to prepare randomized discourses with extremely abstract expressions that fit up in almost all situations.
- The purpose of this project is to have fun imagining how some politicians mock people with empty speeches.
- I've undertaken it in the afternoon of 8 january 2022. That's a very simple code in which I code down a funny game I used to play when I was younger. We had a sheet containing the fragments of politicians discourses and each player had to compose some phrase and say it loud.


## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: JavaScript
- Node v10.19.0.
- VSCode Version 1.63.2
- Git Version 19.12.3 syncing GitHub.
- Linux kubuntu Version 20.04
- Konsole terminal Version 19.12.3

## Setup
You need to have node installed in your machine.

## Usage
Save main.js in a directory and run "node main.js" (without quotes).

`$ node main.js`

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_

## Room for Improvement (TODO)
- Develop and implement a front end interface to provide access to common users.
- Create a postgresq database to store much more text fragments. Conect the page to the database.
- Create parameters to enter the name of the politician, some concrete stuff to substitute words in text and become the game more interesting.
